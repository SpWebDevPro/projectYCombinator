# Project Title: YCombinator

This project is from our Javascript course at Simplon Senart.
We had to reproduce the web site https://news.ycombinator.com/ using the technology we want, using the website API to update the news, and building site structure with components.
I have used:
- AngularJS;
- Gulp as task runner : this was new for me, with the usage of sass, minify, uglify and browserSync.
- Angular-moment : https://github.com/urish/angular-moment  


This project will be the oportunity to test new things as long as i am attending Web Developer courses at Simplon SÃ©nart.
